        ``update_static_properties`` runs on its own, slower

        ``self.published`` makes both cadences cheap: whichever pass ran,
        an idle tick costs no ``setProperty`` calls, only the recompute.

        A failed refresh never ends the loop: the values come from the player

        tick, not a window that stops auto-closing.  ``close_dialog`` runs
