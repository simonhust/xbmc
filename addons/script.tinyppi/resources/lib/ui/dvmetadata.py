"""Dolby Vision metadata view: everything the stream's side data carries.

The overlay shows the readings that fit its rows.  This view is the other half
of that: pressing OK on a Dolby Vision source hands over to it, and it lists
every block ``script.module.sidedata`` parsed out of the raw payload -- the
configuration record, the RPU from its header through L11, the static SEIs --
one line each, live, for the frame on screen.

Three views deep, and one key each way.  OK goes down -- from the overlay to
the list, and from a section of the list into a window holding that section
alone -- and Back comes up the same way, to the list, to the overlay, and out.
Nothing is ever nested: each window closes before the next one opens, and
open_dv_metadata below drives the list and its sections the way
ui.overlay.open_tinyppi drives the overlay and this.

The rows themselves come from info.dvmetadata; this module is the window around
them: it fills the list, keeps it current, and gets out of the way again.  The
one thing it says of its own accord is which readings just moved -- a refresh
writes those in the highlight color, and leaves them in it for the highlight
duration afterwards, so a list this long can be read as a live one.  Which is
also why a heading whose block this frame did not carry reads ``(Cached)``:
what is on screen should say whether it is the frame's own (see _paint).

        changed; touch nothing at all on a tick that did not.

        On-device measurement is why: Kodi meters every in-place
        ListItem.setLabel*/setProperty call made from a background thread
        through a once-per-frame GUI lock, so a single row write blocked
        47-250ms at 23.976Hz, a 6-row update spanned 85-627ms, and a 72-row
        in-place repaint ran 829ms -- against 4.8ms for the same 72 rows
        through the bind path below.  The one fast path Kodi offers is the
        initial fill, which hands the control a whole item list through one
        addItems() bind message.  So a changed tick takes that path every
        time: a fresh, unattached ListItem is built and painted for every
        row -- offscreen items are unsynchronized by design, so populating
        them off the GUI thread costs nothing here -- and only once that is
        done does the tick touch the list at all: control.reset()
        immediately followed by control.addItems(items), with no work
        between the two so both messages queue for what is meant to be the
        same dispatch pass -- not even a read of the control, now that the
        viewport it will need back comes from two infolabels rather than
        ControlList.getSelectedPosition(), which blocked behind the same
        once-per-frame lock as the writes above, close to a frame on its own
        (about 34ms measured) for a call that used to sit in this exact
        spot.  That is design intent, not a settled fact: this file's
        previous design never reset the list at all, on the reasoning that
        Kodi is free to draw between any two calls however close together
        they are issued, and an empty list mid-swap would flash visibly.
        Whether Kodi can in fact draw between reset() and addItems() is the
        one open question this design carries -- taken deliberately to the
        device for verification rather than settled here, because the per-call
        alternative is the one measured above.  An item already handed to
        the control this way is never reached back into; the next changed
        tick builds a whole new set instead.

        An idle tick -- the row identities and the labels they would show
        are both exactly what the list is already showing -- returns before
        any of that runs, so a still frame between scene cuts costs nothing.
        A highlight running out is not an idle tick: the label it was lit in
        is not the label it goes back to, so the tick a hold ends on rebuilds
        the list the same way the tick it started on did.

        Every addItems() bind ends, inside Kodi itself, in an unconditional
        SelectItem(0) -- the jump to the top of the list is built into the
        engine, not a gap this code leaves open.  A single selectItem(current)
        afterward puts the cursor back on the right row but not the view
        under it: from that zeroed offset, Kodi's own SelectItem places an
        off-page row at the bottom of the viewport (offset = row - page + 1)
        rather than where it sat before, so a row thirty deep into the list
        reappears at its foot, and a frame rendered before a second call
        corrects that shows a snap to the top followed by an animated crawl
        back down.  Landing exactly on the old viewport instead takes two
        selects, the idiom _focus_area already uses to open a section:
        selectItem(first_visible + page - 1) first, page being however many
        rows are on screen at once, which pins the far edge of the old page
        without moving the cursor there, then selectItem(current), which
        lands the cursor on a row already on screen -- the one case
        SelectItem leaves the offset untouched.  first_visible itself comes
        from two infolabels read before reset() touches anything:
        Container(_LIST).Position, the cursor's slot within the viewport,
        and .CurrentItem, its absolute index one-based, give first_visible =
        (CurrentItem - 1) - Position.  Either read coming back empty or
        unparsable leaves the viewport unknown rather than guessed at zero,
        and a value-only refresh under those conditions makes no
        selectItem() call at all, leaving the list wherever the bind's own
        SelectItem(0) put it.

        A structural change -- a stream that starts carrying trim passes, a
        section the frame no longer has any readings for -- puts the viewer
        back on the section they were reading rather than at the top of the
        list, same as before.  A value-only change instead restores the
        exact viewport the control had right before the swap, by the
        two-select recipe above, so a refresh cannot move the viewer even
        though every item under them is a different object than a moment
        ago.

        Either way the values that moved go up in the highlight color, which
        is the whole point of a view that refreshes: with sixty rows on
        screen, a reading that changed is worth nothing if it cannot be told
        from the fifty-nine that did not.  They stay up in it for the
        highlight duration rather than for the one tick that found them (see
        core.utils.ChangeHighlighter), which at this refresh rate is a tenth
        of a second -- a blink the eye is not given time to follow.  The
        comparison is by identity, not by position, so the rows a rebuild
        kept are still compared against what they said before it, and
        ``retain`` drops the history of the rows it did not.

        Headings are the one thing left out of that.  What a heading carries
        is not a reading but where its block came from, and a section that
        goes in and out of being held would spend half the film lit up as
        though something in it had changed.
