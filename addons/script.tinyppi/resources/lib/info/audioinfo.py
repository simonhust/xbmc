"""Audio-bitstream metadata via script.module.audiodata.

Kodi reports the audio format it is feeding the sink, not the one the file
carries: during passthrough ``audiobitspersample`` is always 8, and a DTS-HD
track reports its 48 kHz compatibility core rather than the 96/192 kHz the
extension substream stores.  The audiodata module reads those numbers out of
the source bitstream itself, so the overlay can show the true depth and rate of
the track being played.

The stream is read through Kodi's own VFS, so nfs:// / smb:// / bluray:// URLs
work exactly like a local path and nothing has to be copied to disk.  Reading
is sequential and budgeted: the module stops as soon as every track has
answered, and nothing larger than one chunk is ever held in memory.  Detection
runs once per file in a background thread so the polling loop never blocks, and
the completed track list is cached on Kodi's Home window, which survives the
separate script invocations the addon is launched through.

Blu-ray discs are a special case: Kodi hands us the raw ``*.iso``, a
``bluray://`` title stream, or a ``.mpls`` playlist.  ``_resolve_disc_stream``
maps a playlist onto the clip it plays, since that names the title the viewer
picked; a raw image is passed through for audiodata to walk itself, which finds
the main feature by ranking the disc's playlists rather than by clip size.
