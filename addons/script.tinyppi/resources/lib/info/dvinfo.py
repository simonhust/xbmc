"""Dolby Vision / HDR metadata from CoreELEC's raw side-data infolabel.

``Player.Process(video.sidedata)`` is the CoreELEC 22 label through which the
Amlogic video codec publishes the raw payloads of the stream it is decoding --
the Dolby Vision RPU, the dvcC/dvvC configuration record, the HDR10+ ST 2094-40
T.35 message and the static MDCV / CLL SEIs -- base64-encoded in a JSON object.
Kodi itself parses none of it; script.module.sidedata does (libdovi and
libavutil through ctypes), and this module maps its result onto the compact
fields properties.py publishes.

Everything here is live.  The label is re-published per presentation timestamp,
so the per-frame blocks -- L1 (frame luminance, the FLL / PQ rows) and L5 (the
active area the aspect-ratio row is computed from) -- follow the picture rather
than describing a single probed moment of the file.  There is no detection
step, no background worker and nothing to cache across a playback: a parse
happens only when the raw payload actually changes, and the field dict it
yields is held for a fraction of a second so one polling pass over the ~20
getters costs a single parse.

What the side data describes is the source, not the picture after the player
has had its way with it: CoreELEC latches the payloads from the demuxer's own
hints and from the packets before its bitstream conversion runs, and records
what it then did in the ``flags`` key (``converted`` for a profile 4/7 -> 8
rewrite, ``rpu-removed`` / ``hdr10plus-removed`` for metadata stripped for a
display that cannot take it).  So the Dolby Vision profile, its enhancement
layer and the layer structure all still read as the file carries them.

Kodi's own ``VideoPlayer.HdrType`` / ``VideoPlayer.HdrDetail`` are read
alongside: the type classifies HLG, which carries no side-data payload of its
own, and the detail stands in for a Dolby Vision profile that arrives without a
configuration record.

CoreELEC 22 on Amlogic only; on anything else the label stays empty and every
field degrades to its N/A label, exactly as an absent metadata block does.
