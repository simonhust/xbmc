"""Row model for the Dolby Vision metadata view.

``dvinfo`` picks the handful of readings the overlay has room for and formats
each one for its row.  This module does the opposite: it walks the whole parse
result ``script.module.sidedata`` returns -- flags, structure, the dvcC/dvvC
configuration record, every RPU block from the header through L11, and the
static MDCV / CLL SEIs (plus the HDR10+ payload when the stream carries one) --
and lays it out as ``(kind, name, value)`` rows for ui.dvmetadata to put in a list.
Nothing is left out and nothing is interpreted: the metadata view is where you go
to see what the bitstream actually says.

Field names, units and value scalings follow the module's own FIELDS.md, so a
row here reads the same as the documented field it comes from.  Only readings
the bitstream actually carries make it into the list: a field the stream leaves
out is dropped rather than shown as a dash, and a section left with nothing to
say drops with it, so the view is what this stream has rather than a form with
most of its boxes blank.  Everything is read live: the per-frame blocks (L1,
L2, L5, L8) move with the picture, the title-level ones stand still.

Carries what a frame omits, though.  Under DM metadata compression an RPU
refers back to an earlier frame's metadata rather than repeating it, so a block
this stream plainly has -- L2, L8, the source range, the title-level levels --
is missing from most frames of it.  Read strictly frame by frame those sections
would come and go every second or two; instead the last block that arrived
stands until a new one replaces it (see _hold).

Formatting only, apart from the stream labels and the parser version the first
section names, and the held blocks the live path fills in: hand ``build_rows``
a parse result of your own and it yields the same rows anywhere, holding
nothing.
