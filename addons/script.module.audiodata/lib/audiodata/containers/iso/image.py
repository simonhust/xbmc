"""Random access over a disc image, and a bounded reader for one clip inside it.

A Kodi VFS handle cannot be memory-mapped, and a Blu-ray ISO runs to tens of
gigabytes, so the filesystem walks are driven by reading the ranges they ask
for as they ask for them.  Every read is bounded and nothing larger than the
requested range is held.
